## About the Challenge

This challenge had me look at the complete data from the company's most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice, who had SCC tumors, received treatment with a range of drug regimens over a course of 45 days where the tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose if this study was to compare the preformance of Capomulin, the company's drug of interest, and how it compared to the other treatments.
I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study as well as providing a summary of the study results.

## Analysis

After looking over the data, the most effectice drug seemed to be Ramicane. Ramicane had the smallest mean as well as a lower distribution of final tumor volumes. Capomulin is a close second, with its mean tumor volume being about 0.4 mm3 more than Ramicane. Capomulin's distribution of final tumor volumes is very close to Ramicane's distribution, but it does have a smaller interquatile range than Ramicane.

Based on the statistics summary, Ketapril is the least effective treatment due to having the highest average tumor volume and largest variance tumor volume.

With a correlation coefficient of 0.84, Capomulin has a strong positive correlation between the mice's weight and average tumor volume.

For a better comparison, the correlation between weight and average tumor volume for each drug regimen should be considered.
